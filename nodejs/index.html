					<h2>The S14</h2>
					<img src="s14.jpg">
					<p>The S14 Silvia debuted in Japan towards the end of 1993. It was lower and wider 
					than the S13. New rounded styling contributed to the illusion of a greater increase in size
					than actually occurred.
					Wheelbase and track were both increased, leading to slightly improved handling. 
					Unlike export markets, where sales of the S14 chassis variants faltered, the Silvia remained
					popular in Japan.
					However, the width dimension exceeded 1700 mm, which pushed this generation out of the compact class
					tax bracket, which also made Japanese buyers liable for higher road taxes. The fastback and convertible 
					bodystyles were discontinued internationally, leaving only the coupe in production.</p>
